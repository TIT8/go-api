Go api for Triennale-elettronica-polimi "e-mail us" [section](https://triennale-elettronica-polimi.netlify.app/contact/#e-mail-us) with [friendly captcha](https://friendlycaptcha.com/) protection.

It sends message to a Telegram-bot and it's hosted on [flyio](https://fly.io/), automatically deployed on master changes via [Github Actions](https://github.com/TIT8/go-api/actions/workflows/fly.yml).

I would like to express my gratitude to [Marius](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-use-go-to-send-telegram-messages-to-your-phone-a819bdf7f35c) for his well-explained blog post, which served as an inspiration for my API.
